SuperCode enhances your coding experience by letting you interact with your IDE using voice commands. Vibe coding how it should be.


_-> ðŸŒ‰ Based in SF? [Let's collaborate and shape the future of conversational coding](#partnering)_

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Voice-Activated Commands**: Trigger actions with the "activate" keyword
- **IDE Integration**: Seamlessly works with supported IDEs (Cursor, Lovable, etc.)
- **Real-time Status Display**: Always know what SuperCode is doing with the overlay UI

### Most Used Features
**Talk to your IDE with natural language commands**: 
- "Activate type [text]" - Have the AI type and edit code for you
- "Activate change [ide]" - Switch to a different [supported IDE](#supported-ai-ides)
- "Activate learn [element] [name]" - Teach SuperCode about a new UI element
- "Activate click [element]" - Click a learned UI element
- "Activate find [text]" - Search for text in the current file
**Real-time voice notifications** - receive instant alerts when coding tasks are completed, eliminating the need to manually check if the coding agent is done.

## Supported AI IDEs
- Cursor - The AI-first code editor
- Windsurf - Open source AI coding environment
- Lovable - AI-powered web IDE for full-stack development
- Coming Soon: Claude Code, Base44, Bolt, v0

## Installation

For the easiest setup experience, use our installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saharmor/supercode.git
cd supercode

# Run the installation script (automatically sets up everything)
./install_and_run.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for Python 3.8+ and install requirements
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Prompt for required API keys if not found
4. Configure the .env file (using .example.env as a template)
5. Launch SuperCode



## API Keys Needed
- Anthropic API key for Claude Computer Use - [see guide for getting your key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp4we-ged4w)
- OpenAI API key for Whisper transcription, optional, otherwise uses Google free ASR - [see guide for getting your key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)
- Google Gemini API key for screenshots and image analysis - [see guide for getting your key](https://github.com/saharmor/gemini-multimodal-playground?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-your-gemini-api-key)

## Configuration
SuperCode uses a `.env` file for configuration. An example template (`.example.env`) is provided with the repository. The installation script will automatically create this file for you, but you can also manually copy and edit it:

```bash
cp .example.env .env
# Then edit .env with your preferred text editor
```

## System Requirements
- macOS (currently macOS-only)
- Requires Accessibility permissions

### Costs
- Approximately $0.2/hour with default settings, originating from Claude Computer Use, which finds the location of the interacted elements on yoru screen, and OpenAI `gpt-4o-transcribe`
- Can be ~80% cheaper using Google's free ASR, but at the cost of lower transcription quality

## Usage

```
Activate [command] [parameters]
```

Example commands:
- `Activate type Write a function that sorts an array` - Start typing in the IDE
- `Activate change lovable` - Switch to the Lovable interface
- `Activate learn Accept the blue button to the right that runs the suggested terminal code` - Teach a new button

## Current Limitations

SuperCode is actively being developed, and there are some current limitations to be aware of:

- **English Only**: Currently only supports English language for voice commands and responses
- **Display Requirements**: The IDE should remain open on your primary display for proper screen monitoring and interaction
- **macOS Only**: Currently only compatible with macOS, with Windows and Linux support planned for future releases

## Data Usage

SuperCode interacts with several external APIs to function. Here's what data is sent:

**Screenshots**
- When SuperCode starts and when you switch IDEs, screenshots are sent to Claude Computer Use to find screen coordinates for UI elements (input boxes, buttons, etc.)
- After executing commands, screenshots may be sent to Gemini Flash to monitor when the command is completed
- These screenshots are only of your active IDE window and used only for application functionality
  
**Audio**
- Your voice commands are sent to either OpenAI API (if enabled) for high-quality transcription or  Google's free speech recognition service
- Audio is only transmitted when actively recording a command
  

All data transmission is done securely via API providers' encrypted connections. No data is stored by SuperCode beyond the current session.

## Coming Soon
- Electron app for a more native experience
- Claude Code integration with reminder to run /compact
- Consolidating API providers (currently using Claude, Gemini, and GPT)
- Gemini Flash / OpenAI Realtime transcription
- Model selector when using "Activate Type" to optimize credits usage
- Error detection and fixing suggestions
- Rabbit hole detector to keep you on track
- Commit message generation for Windsurf
- Realtime audio APIs for faster and smoother experience
- Function calling for more robust voice command processing
- Support for additional languages: Spanish, German, and French

# SuperSurf âœ¨

> The conversational assistant for vibe coders

SuperSurf enhances your coding experience by letting you interact with your IDE using voice commands. Vibe coding how it should be.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Voice-Activated Commands**: Trigger actions with the "activate" keyword
- **IDE Integration**: Seamlessly works with supported IDEs (Cursor, Lovable, etc.)
- **Real-time Status Display**: Always know what SuperSurf is doing with the overlay UI

### Most Used Features
**Talk to your IDE with natural language commands**: 
- "Activate type [text]" - Have the AI type and edit code for you
- "Activate change [ide]" - Switch to a different supported IDE
- "Activate learn [element] [name]" - Teach SuperSurf about a new UI element
- "Activate click [element]" - Click a learned UI element
- "Activate find [text]" - Search for text in the current file
**Real-time voice notifications** - receive instant alerts when coding tasks are completed, eliminating the need to manually check if the coding agent is done.

## Supported AI IDEs
- Cursor - The AI-first code editor
- Windsurf - Open source AI coding environment
- Lovable - AI-powered web IDE for full-stack development
- Coming Soon: Claude Code, Base44, Bolt, v0

## Setup & Requirements

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies

### API Keys Needed
- Anthropic API key (for Claude Computer Use) - [see guide for getting your key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp4we-ged4w)
- OpenAI API key (for Whisper transcription, optional, otherwise uses Google free ASR) - [see guide for getting your key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)
- Google Gemini API key (for screenshots and image analysis) - [see guide for getting your key](https://github.com/saharmor/gemini-multimodal-playground?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-your-gemini-api-key)


### System Requirements
- macOS (currently macOS-only)
- Requires Accessibility permissions
- Works optimally when IDE is on your primary screen

### Costs
- Approximately $0.2/hour with default settings, originating from Claude Computer Use, which finds the location of the interacted elements on yoru screen, and OpenAI `gpt-4o-transcribe`
- Can be ~80% cheaper using Google's free ASR, but with lower transcription quality

## Usage

```
Activate [command] [parameters]
```

Example commands:
- `Activate type Write a function that sorts an array` - Start typing in the IDE
- `Activate change lovable` - Switch to the Lovable interface
- `Activate learn Accept the blue button to the right that runs the suggested terminal code` - Teach a new button


## Coming Soon
- Electron app for a more native experience
- Claude Code integration with reminder to run /compact
- Gemini Flash / OpenAI Realtime transcription
- Model selector when using "Activate Type" to optimize credits usage
- Error detection and fixing suggestions
- Rabbit hole detector to keep you on track
- Commit message generation for Windsurf
- Realtime audio APIs for faster and smoother experience
- Function calling for more robust voice command processing
